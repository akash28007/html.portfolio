<hr>
<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>It is one the favourit movie of mine. The storyline , chemistry betwwen actors, acting skills all are just top notch i don't think there can any other movie could be mde like this one. </p>
<h3>The batman begins series</h3>
<p>This also one of the most attractive and amazing movies of all time for me. the storyline revolves around the fantasies i use to create and love to live in it before sleeping every night. </p>
<h3>Sita Ramam </h3>
<p>This is the best romantic movie i have seen made in india ever. it can be called indian titatnic. and i rate titatnic as the best romantic movie ever made in this world out of my knowledge and when it comes to comparing with sita Ramam i feel that i cannot rate any of them below any of them both. </p>
<h3>The Spiderman</h3>
<p>This is the best sci-fi movie i have watched. i can't explain the feeling for this movie when i was a child even today i can happily watch this movie numerous time. released early in 2003 but still it never feels old to me. </p>
